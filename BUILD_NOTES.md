# How I started 

* I first thought it would be a good idea to have a simple front end done. So I can see things and how they are working. 
* Then I wanted to connect this front-end to the backend to see if the prompts were being sent around
* To enable this I believe I need to get the web-sockets working
* After this we will try to run an api node from an external service
* And finally run it on our own pc and see how it goes!
